Hand Guester
Overview
Hand Guester is a Python-based computer vision project designed to recognize and interpret hand gestures in real time. It leverages machine learning and image processing techniques to enable contactless control of applications using simple hand movements captured via a webcam.

This system can be used for gesture-based interaction, automation control, and educational demonstrations of AI in computer vision.

Features
Real-time hand tracking using camera input

Static and dynamic gesture recognition

Customizable gesture mapping for different actions

Lightweight and runs on standard hardware

Built with Python and OpenCV for easy integration

Applications
Touchless computer interaction or virtual mouse control

Smart home automation control systems

Educational demos for computer vision and AI

Accessible computing for users with movement limitations

Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or above

OpenCV (cv2)

MediaPipe

NumPy

PyAutoGUI (for keyboard/mouse automation, if used)

You can install dependencies with:

bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy pyautogui
How to Run
Clone this repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/Shakthivijay/hand_guester.git
cd hand_guester
Run the main Python script:

bash
python hand_guester.py
Place your hand in front of the webcam and perform gestures.
The recognized gestures will correspond to specific control actions depending on the implementation logic in the script.
